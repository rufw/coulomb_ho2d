    Calculation of the Coulomb repulsion matrix elements in the basis of a
    two-dimensional harmonic oscillator.

    @mainpage Coulomb HO2D

    This code calculates the Coulomb repulsion matrix elements in the basis of
    a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator.

    ### Usage

    To use the library, simply compile `coulomb_ho2d.c` and statically link it
    with your program.  You can build a shared library too, but this may
    reduce performance.  It is highly recommended that the code be compiled at
    maximum optimization level.  Use unsafe floating-point optimizations
    (e.g. `-ffast-math`) at your own discretion.

    The API documentation can be found in `coulomb_ho2d.h`.

    The code has been tested with GCC and Clang and has minimal dependencies.
    It is written in comforming C99 / C++11 and uses the standard library.  No
    external libraries are required, although you may need to explicitly link
    to the standard math library.

    It can also be compiled in C89 / C++03 provided that suitable replacements
    for `tgamma` and `stdint.h` are supplied.  If `<stdint.h>` is not
    available, define `NO_STDINT_H` instead (this may impact performance).

    The precision of the results is less than `1e-7`.

/** Calculates the Coulomb matrix element in a 2D harmonic oscillator basis.

    Returns the matrix element:

        <n1, ml1; n2, ml2 | V | n3, ml3; n4, ml4>

    where `V` is the two-particle Coulomb repulsion operator.  The matrix
    element is not antisymmetrized and does not consider spin.

    An analytic expression is used to calculate the matrix element (see the
    referenced paper by Anisimovas & Matulis).

    @param n1, n2, n3, n4
               The principal quantum numbers in the 2D harmonic oscillator
               basis and can be any nonnegative number.

    @param ml1, ml2, ml3, ml4
               The angular momentum projection quantum number and can be any
               integer.

    @return    The value of the matrix element, or `NAN` if an error occurs.

    @note      For "historical reasons", the last two index pairs are swapped
               in the parameter list.

    @warning   This function is not thread-safe as it uses a statically
               allocated cache to speed up the calculations.  For
               thread-safety, use `#coulomb_ho2d_r` instead.
